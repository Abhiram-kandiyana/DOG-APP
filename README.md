# DOG-APP
## Dog breed classifier using CNN
In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
It uses openCV and convolution neural networks to achieve this.
