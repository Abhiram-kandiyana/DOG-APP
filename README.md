# DOG-APP
## Dog breed classifier using CNN
In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
It uses openCV and convolution neural networks to achieve this.
We use convolution neural network to classify over 133 dog breeds.We train the model with over 8000 images of dogs with their breeds labeled.It uses openCV to detect the faces .It can detect a human face and tell the breed of dog it resembles.We come to know the potential of Deep learning in this project.I used transfer learning from Resnet50 which is trained with 10,000 images of 1000 classes from ImageNet. 
At the end of the project:
1. If you feed a dog's picture it detects its breed.
2. If you feed a human's picture it detects the dog breed it resembles
3. If you feed a picture other than dog or human it tells that It is neither a human nor dog.
